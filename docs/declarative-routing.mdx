# Declarative Routing
[go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) is governed by a set of routes which you specify as part of the GoRouter constructor.

In this part, you will learn how to declare route with GoRouter constructor. 
Inside your config folder, please create file <em>route.dart</em> as follow code as below:

```
final router = GoRouter(
  routes: [
    GoRoute(
      path: '/',
      name: 'HomePage',
      builder: (context, state) => const HomePage(),
      routes: [
        GoRoute(
          path: 'books',
          name: 'Books',
          builder: (context, state) => const Books(),
          routes: [
            GoRoute(
              path: ':id',
              name: 'BookDetail',
              builder: (context, state) => BookDetail(
                id: int.tryParse(state.params['id']!),
              ),
            )
          ],
        )
      ],
    )
  ],
);

```
